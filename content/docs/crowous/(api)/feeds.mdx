## What is a feed?

A feed is a specific Crous. There's multiple Crous in France, each one has its own feed.
To access a feed you need to know its identifier, which is unique.

You can access them using `feeds()` which returns a list of all available feeds.

## Listing feeds

Let's say we want to list all available feeds by showing their name and identifier.

<Tabs items={['JS/TS', 'Kotlin', 'Rust']}>
```ts tab="JS/TS"
import * as crous from "crowous";

const feeds = await crous.feeds();

for (const feed of feeds) {
  console.log(`${feed.name} (${feed.identifier})`);
}
```
 
```ts tab="Kotlin"
import ink.literate.crowous.api.feeds

suspend fun main() {
  val feeds = feeds()

  for (feed in feeds) {
    println("${feed.name} (${feed.identifier})")
  }
}
```

```ts tab="Rust"
// Not yet available!
```
</Tabs>

```console title="output.txt"
AIX-MARSEILLE (aix.marseille)
AMIENS (amiens)
ANTILLES-GUYANES (antilles.guyane)
```

## What's next?

You'll receive an `identifier` that can be used with `restaurants()`, for example, to retrieve the list of restaurants available for a given Crous.
