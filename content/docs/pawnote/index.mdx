## Supported

### Versions

### Sessions

- Encrypted
- Compressed

### Accounts

- `élève` (student)

A support for other accounts (such as parents) will be added in the future.

### Authentication

- `username` and `password` (no ENT/CAS)
- `username` and `token`
- [QR Code](https://forum.index-education.com/upfiles/qrcode.png)

#### Note about ENT/CAS native support

It's **not and will never** be supported by Pawnote, for the reason that implementing each of them with every specificities requires a lot of time and effort. It's a pain to implement and track; as a matter of fact, most of the issues on [pronotepy](https://github.com/bain3/pronotepy/issues) - a similar project - are related to it. If you need to authenticate to an account protected by an ENT/CAS, you should go for the token or QR Code authentication.

#### Note about demonstration servers

Credentials (username and password without ENT/CAS) authentication works, but **token and QR Code authentication won't work**.

This is because demonstration servers doesn't save next-time tokens, even if it's able to generate them.

You can know if a server is a demonstration or not by reading the `isDemo` property on a `Pronote` instance in Pawnote.
