A collection of utilities for our libraries to prevent us from writing the same code again and again in multiple repositories that finally gets out of sync.

Only written for JS/TS and internal use. We don't recommend using this package in your projects **unless you want to implement a custom fetcher**.

## Installation

```bash
npm add "@literate.ink/utilities"
bun add "@literate.ink/utilities"
pnpm add "@literate.ink/utilities"
yarn add "@literate.ink/utilities"
```
